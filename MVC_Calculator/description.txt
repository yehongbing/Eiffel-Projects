MVC pattern example - graphing calculator
-----------------------------------------

A more complex MVC model.  There are two views (screens), hence two controllers.
    calculator_view_controller.e
    function_graph_vc.e

There is one model] shared by the two controllers
    calculator.e

The remaining classes implement support data types and the execution starings
point.

Entry is in postfix notation. Enter is used primarily to indicate the end of
a numbe, otherwise if the "entry type" changes the view controller enters the
Enter for you.

The graph function is f(x) where x is the variable on the pad.

Here is a long example illustrating how the calculator works.  The first graph
displayed is  f(x) = x * cos(x), then x / cos(x), then x * sin(x).

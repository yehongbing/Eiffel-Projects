Observer pattern example
-------------------------

The observer pattern is based on the observation (pun not intended) that the state
of an object may be viewed from many different perspectives.  With the observer
pattern we decouple the dependency  of the subject (the state changes of an
object) from the observers of the state.

In this example, the cluster 'observer' contains a deferred class OBSERVER from
which all observers inherit.  Observers are notified via the update method that
they need to update their view of the subject, and observers can verify that their
view is up to date with respect to the subject.

The cluster models_and_views contains a subject, also known as a model, of
the kelvin temperature in which the temperature can be changed.  The cluster
also contains three views of the model, the FARENHEIT_VIEW, the CENTIGRADE_VIEW
and the KELVIN_VIEW,  where each view reports on the state of the KELVIN_MODEL.
